The following code was adapted from the example code for the RAZOR 9 DOF IMU by
Sparkfun. In its present state, the code configures the IMU to report
orientation data, acceleration data, and a vector clock time stamp over the
primary serial port (the one accessible via micro-usb) and a secondary serial
port configured over pins 10 and 11. The IMU can also receive commands over both
serial ports. For instance, sending an 'a' over the secondary serial port
triggers a reinitialization sequence.
